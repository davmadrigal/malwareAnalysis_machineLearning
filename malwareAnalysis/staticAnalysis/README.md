# Overview
The staticAnalysis folder contains various files related to the static analysis of binaries for malware detection. It includes the main script multipleStaticParser.py, the generated dataset files (DatasetAll.csv, DatasetReducedBalanced.csv, DatasetMasGoodware.csv), and a configuration file staticfeature.txt.
# multipleStaticParser.py
The multipleStaticParser.py script performs static analysis on binary files located in a defined path. Specifically, this script:

- Analyzes PE (Portable Executable) files
- Iterates over the directory, where all binaries have the same naming pattern: SampleXXX
- Sorts all the binaries
- Extracts features based on the staticfeature.txt file
- Writes each feature row to a CSV file to create the datasets

To run this script, use the command python3 multipleStaticParser.py.
# Dataset
The following CSV files contain the datasets generated by the multipleStaticParser.py script:

- DatasetAll.csv: Contains the complete dataset with all samples.
- DatasetReducedBalanced.csv: Contains a reduced and balanced dataset between malware and benign software samples.
- DatasetMasGoodware.csv: Contains a dataset with more benign software samples than malware samples.

# staticfeature.txt
The staticfeature.txt file contains the list of features extracted by the multipleStaticParser.py script during the static analysis of the binaries.
