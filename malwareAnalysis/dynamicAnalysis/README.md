# Overview
The dynamicAnalysis folder contains various files related to the dynamic analysis of binaries for malware detection. It includes:

- [sendBinariesToCukooSandoxForAnalysis](./sendBinariesToCukooSandoxForAnalysis)
- [analyzeCuckooReports](./analyzeCuckooReports)
- [reduceWithPCA](./reduceWithPCA)
- [utils](./utils)


# sendBinariesToCukooSandoxForAnalysis
sendBinariesToCuckoo.py script.
- sends binaires to cuckoo sandbox using cuckoo submit.
- check the analysis status using its REST API.
- timeout configured in 120 seconds per analysis.

# analyzeCuckooReports
Two files compressed: features.tar.gz (contains all features extracted from the report.json files) and resultadosAll.tar.gz is the original dataset compressed with all the features.
- extractFeaturesFromCuckooReports.py: extract all features from the reports.
- generateDataset.py: create the dataset based on the features extracted.

# reduceWitPCA
In order to have simpler files to be able to train with the ML models, the files are split in groups based on the class features, reduced in size with 2000 goodware and 2000 malware and applied PCA to reduce the number of dimensions. 

Two files compressed: 
- filesSplits.tar.gz: files split by features class and reduced in size. The split was done manually using cut command in linux and the size reduction is done with get2000FirstAndLast.sh, included in the file.
- filesReducedPCA.tar.gz: contains all files reduced with PCA and one file contatenated with all features reduced (final_final_with_headers.csv). This file is split in two files due to its size, they are called part_aa and part_ab. They can be downloaded and join using cat command, like cat part_aa part_ab > filesReducedPCA.tar.gz, and uncompress the file generated.

- reduceWithPCA.py: script to reduce the files. Read all files from the specific folder and creates a folder with the files reduced and pca plots.

# utils
extractUniqueFeatures.py: creates the list of unique features extracted in features.txt file
